            <p>
            Greetings! I'm Hayden, my passion is designing and programming games. Currently pursuing a
            degree in Games, Interactive Media, and Mobile Technology(GIMM) at Boise State University, my primary focus revolves
            around programming and level design. With that said I would characterize myself a versatile generalist who can contribute on a little bit of everything.
            I have a strong commitment to continous learning and feel like I should always be improving or honing my skills.
            Feel free to explore some of my showcased works or to reach out and contact me.
            </p>

        <p> This was my first game created during GIMM 100, it was a simple point and click
        that had a later segment where it was a top down action game fighting flying drones.
        is this project I used Adobe Animate and the trailer was made in Premier Pro during a later GIMM course.<br />
