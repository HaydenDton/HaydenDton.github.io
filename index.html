        <h2>About me</h2>
        <div>Greetings! I'm Hayden, my passion is designing and programming games. Currently pursuing a
        degree in Games, Interactive Media, and Mobile Technology(GIMM) at Boise State University, my primary focus revolves
        around programming and level design. With that said I would characterize myself a versatile generalist who can contribute on a little bit of everything.
        I have a strong commitment to continous learning and feel like I should always be improving or honing my skills.
        Feel free to explore some of my showcased works or to reach out and contact me.</div>
